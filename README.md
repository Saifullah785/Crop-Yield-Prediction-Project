# Crop-Yield-Prediction-Project
This project analyzes agricultural yield data to predict crop yields based on various factors such as year, rainfall, pesticide usage, temperature, area, and crop type.The data is loaded, cleaned, and preprocessed, including handling missing values and transforming categorical features. Exploratory data analysis is performed to visualize the relationships between different variables and crop yield. Several regression models are trained and evaluated to identify the best performing model for yield prediction. Finally, a predictive system is developed using the selected model to estimate crop yields for given input conditions.
